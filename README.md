# ZJU-DB-Library-Management-System
This repository is for the lab 5 of database course in ZJU, the library management system. All the code in the repository can run in the environment of python 3.12+ with the suitable packages. I also record a video for explain the usage of the whole system, most of the functions are tested, and some are not. 

I also update the report myself, as the report is being finished in overleaf, so I do not want to 
upload the tex file, you want, please message me at gmail:masterforliage@gmail.com.

My personal information is being published in the report, so a forward is not permitted.
